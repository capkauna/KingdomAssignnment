School asignment focused on simulating the gem sourcing process of a kingdom. 
The simulation handles managing artificial waiting times, logging activity, a queue system, 'manually' handling the reader-writer problem and interface use, specifically implementing architectural design patterns such as proxy and strategy.
It also features little fun easter eggs, such as unexpected finds in the gem mine (children, cows, ghosts, unicorns and princesses), and the different handling of each.

The assignment also asked for a junit testing of a given list class, which can be found in the files here, although they are not involved in the Kingdom functionalities.

Everything was brought to life by a team of five students.
